### Bugs & Fixes
1.    The form on the contact page zooms in on mobile devices when a user focuses on an input field:
        * Change font-size from 14px to 16px.
2.    CSS & Images directory placed in the root:
        * Create assets directory and move both CSS and Images directory into it.
3.    Hover pseudo not working on mobile:
        * Add focus pseudo that works as best alternative to hover in mobile.
4.    Self closing html item has symbol /:
        * Remove symbol / from every self closing html item like img, meta because HTML validator gives error when symbol / exists with self closing items.

### Unfixed bugs
* None
